I rebuilt this site as my public workspace for ideas, experiments, and shipping notes.

The goal is simple: publish practical lessons from building real software, not just polished highlights.

You can expect:

- short technical write-ups from active projects,
- behind-the-scenes notes on decisions and tradeoffs,
- occasional long-form posts when something is worth documenting in depth.

If you enjoy concrete engineering content and transparent product thinking, you're in the right place.
