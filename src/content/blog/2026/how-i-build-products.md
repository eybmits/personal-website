My default product loop is intentionally small:

1. write a one-paragraph problem statement,
2. ship the smallest useful version,
3. collect feedback fast,
4. tighten the rough edges,
5. repeat.

I avoid long speculative planning phases and prefer learning from usage as early as possible.

That does not mean "move fast and break everything." It means keeping scope narrow enough that quality, performance, and maintainability stay under control.

Speed comes from clear decisions, not from skipping engineering fundamentals.
