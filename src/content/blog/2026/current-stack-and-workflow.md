My stack changes over time, but my evaluation criteria stay stable:

- does it reduce friction?
- does it improve reliability?
- does it keep complexity understandable?

Right now I optimize for fast local feedback, predictable deployments, and clear observability.

On the workflow side, I prefer short implementation cycles, frequent verification, and explicit technical notes while context is fresh.

This keeps projects maintainable and makes collaboration easier as scope grows.
